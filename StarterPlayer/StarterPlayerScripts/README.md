# StarterPlayerScripts

LocalScripts placed in StarterPlayerScripts run once for each player when they join the game. These scripts:
- Run on the client side
- Have access to client-only services like UserInputService
- Persist for the entire time the player is in the game
- Are commonly used for player-specific UI, input handling, and client-side systems
