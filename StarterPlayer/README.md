# StarterPlayer

StarterPlayer contains scripts and settings that affect how players spawn and behave. It includes two important subfolders:

- **StarterPlayerScripts**: LocalScripts that run once per player when they join
- **StarterCharacterScripts**: LocalScripts that run each time a player's character spawns

This service also contains properties that control player behavior like walk speed, jump height, and health.
