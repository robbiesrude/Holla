# StarterCharacterScripts

LocalScripts placed in StarterCharacterScripts run each time a player's character spawns. These scripts:
- Run on the client side
- Are copied to the player's character model when it spawns
- Run again each time the character respawns
- Are commonly used for character-specific effects, animations, and controls
