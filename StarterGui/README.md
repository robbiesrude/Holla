# StarterGui

StarterGui contains GUI objects that are copied to each player's PlayerGui when they join. This includes:
- ScreenGuis for the main UI
- LocalScripts for client-side GUI functionality
- Menus, HUDs, and interface elements
- Client-side UI logic

All contents are automatically given to each player when they join the game.
