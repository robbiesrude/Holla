# ServerScriptService

ServerScriptService is a container for server-side scripts. Scripts placed here:
- Run only on the server
- Have access to server-only APIs
- Can handle game logic, data persistence, and server events
- Are not visible to clients for security

This is where you place your main game logic and server-side functionality.
