# ReplicatedStorage

ReplicatedStorage is a container whose contents are visible to both the server and all connected clients. This is commonly used for:
- Shared modules and libraries
- RemoteEvents and RemoteFunctions for client-server communication
- Assets that both client and server need access to
- Configuration data

Objects placed here are replicated to all clients automatically.
